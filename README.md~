HBaiduMusic
===========

A Baidu Online Music Player on Linux

Following functions should be implemented for alpha version

+ The GUI should not be too ugly!!

+ Select a music in the list to play and download
+ Love one music and collect it (local)
+ Playlist support (local)
+ (optional, and not considered in alpha version) Log-in using baidu account (This is difficult because baidu seems to not support music api)
